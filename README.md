# Random password generator

In this activity, I have developed a random password generator. 

+ The script starts when the user click the button to generate a password.
+ Then the user is prompeted with the number of characters needed for the password.
+ After that, we ask if the special characters are needed on the password.

Once the password is generated, we can start the script again by pressig the button to generate de password.
